# Intro

### Examples

Stop me if you've heard this one before:

*Three logicians walk into a bar. The bartender asks, "do you all want a beer?"*

-   *First logician: "I don't know"*
-   *Second logician: "I don't know"*
-   *Third logician: "Yes!"*


### Explanation

How does this work? Each logician really does want a beer, but he doesn't know if his colleagues want one. If the bartender's question is taken literally ("do **all** of you want a beer), no logician knows the answer. (On other hand, if any of the logicians didn't want a beer, he or she could answer,"no".) After the first two logicians give their "I don't know" answers (thus - they do want a beer), the third logician can give a definite answer.

### Generalization

Our three logicians may or may not want a beer; 3 logicians and 2 options means there are ${2}^{3}$ = `r 2**3` ways the joke could unfold. But! Some of these outcomes are identical. For example, if the first logician doesn't want a beer, the answers are "no", "no", and "no", no matter what the second and third logicians want.

There are other forms of this joke, depending on the bartender's question.
An alternative, equally funny, but less jolly form of the joke is:

*Three logicians walk into a bar. The bartender asks, "do any of you want a beer?"*

-   *First logician: "I don't know"*
-   *Second logician: "I don't know"*
-   *Third logician: "No!"*

How many different questions can the bartender ask?
