# Intro

### The Joke

*Three logicians walk into a bar. The bartender asks, "do you all want a beer?"*

-   *First logician: "I don't know"*
-   *Second logician: "I don't know"*
-   *Third logician: "Yes!"*


### Explanation

How does this work? Each logician really does want a beer, but he doesn't know if his colleagues want one. If the bartender's question is taken literally ("do **all** of you want a beer), no logician knows the answer. (On other hand, if any of the logicians didn't want a beer, he or she could answer,"no".) After the first two logicians give their "I don't know" answers (thus - they do want a beer), the third logician can give a definite answer.

### Generalizations

#### Forms of the Joke

There are other forms of this joke, depending on the bartender's question.
An alternative, equally funny, but less jolly form of the joke is:

*Three logicians walk into a bar. The bartender asks, "do any of you want a beer?"*

-   *First logician: "I don't know"*
-   *Second logician: "I don't know"*
-   *Third logician: "No!"*

In this case, no one wanted a beer, but only the 3rd logician knew enough to answer the bartender.

Here's a third form of the joke:

*Three logicians walk into a bar. The bartender asks, "do an odd number of you want a beer?"*

-   *First logician: "I don't know"*
-   *Second logician: "I don't know"*
-   *Third logician: "I don't know!"*

How many different questions can the bartender ask?

#### Logicians' Desires

Our three logicians may or may not want a beer; 3 logicians and 2 options means there are ${2}^{3}$ = `r 2**3` ways the joke could unfold. But! Some of these outcomes are identical. For example, if the first logician doesn't want a beer, the answers are "no", "no", and "no", no matter what the second and third logicians want.
